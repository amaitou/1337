# The School
> 42 is the entire network. 1337 is a part of 42.

42 is a nonprofit and private school, that offers a new methodology of learning since there are no teachers and no classrooms, students are not chained to a specific time for the reason that the school is open 24/7 days which gives them the full freedom of studying whenever they want per day.
If you read this, you might get confused about how the students learn. well, at 42 there is something named "Peer-To-Peer Learning" since the students teach and learn from each other as the school provides them with highly performed computers, a high level of internet speed, as well an appropriate environment that encourages the students to code. Moreover, the school is free for whoever is selected after its selection process also known as "Piscine" which is a 30-day of coding that decides if you are qualified to attend the school and become a "cadet".

# The Process
> Both booking places and passing the evaluations will be done online.

The process is taken to attend the school is obvious as you have to pass the online test, book a place in what is named "Check-In", book a place in "Piscine" and attempt the best of yours in 30-day of coding so you can get selected. <br />
The piscine is a month when you will be learning and doing exercises "Days" that cover the **C Programming Language** and some of the **Shell Scripting**, as well as you will be tested every Friday in an exam where you will be doing exercises related to what you have studied before.
